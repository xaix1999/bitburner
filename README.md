# Bit burner
**scripts used to automate hacking on all hosts

These are some scripts I use to auto exec hacks to auto gen cash in this game.
There are scripts from others that I have modified in order to "better" run in my play through.
Scripts have been updated to run on all bit nodes (maybe).
Your mileage may vary. Stocks & Hacknets seem to not be as profitable as I hoped.

V1.4.0 compatible

less8.js - 7.00 GB - Rewrite of gen_auto.js to use less than 8 GB for fresh new runs. It will pickup player owned servers as long as the name is similiar to the pserv.js format, or more exactly, starts with "s-".

gen_auto.js - 8.20 GB - deprecated

hnet.js - 5.70 GB - Set at buying 5 upgrades per cycle/chance (when the money is available), also added hash sells. Reduced ram usages by 0.4 GB.

pserv.js - 7.35 GB - Rewritten to reduce GB.

start.js - 4.15 GB - A brute force version of a wget with a start of programs.

stonks.js - 21.70 GB - Stock manager requiring tix and api access.
