**scripts used to automate hacking on all hosts

These are some scripts I use to auto exec hacks to auto gen cash in this game.
There are scripts from others that I have modified in order to "better" run in my play through.
Scripts have been updated to run on all bit nodes (maybe).
Your mileage may vary. Stocks & Hacknets seem to not be as profitable as I hoped.

V1.4.0 compatible

8plus.js - 8.15 GB - It's Back! Started as a 1/1/1 hack/grow/weaken batch script, and was reduced to "multithreading" batches in order to stay under the 75k thread issue of my client locking up. "Improvement" over less8. Less8.js is a type of stepping stone until you are able to have 1024+ GB servers available to you, which is a requirement for 8plus.js to function correctly, lower than 1024 GB of ram will have reduced performance.

corrupt.js - 249.6 / 63.6 / 17.1 GB per Source-File 4 level - Simple script to commit crimes in bitnodes that have less profitable hacking.

doubles.js - 45.6 GB - Script used to make sure that sleeves are recovered and able to train combat stats. Currently set to do "Larceny" for the hacking exp and money.

*hnet.js - 5.70 GB - Set at buying 5 upgrades per cycle/chance (when the money is available), also added hash sells. Reduced ram usages by 0.4 GB.

less8.js - 8.00 GB - Rewrite of previous hack script to use less than 8 GB for fresh new runs. It will pickup player owned servers as long as the name is similiar to the pserv.js format, or more exactly, starts with "s-" or "hacknet-node-". Scripted targets until you are 220+ hacking level.

pserv.js - 7.40 GB - Rewritten to reduce GB. Updated for BitNodes with reduced max ram amounts.

share.js - 7.35 GB - Script used to share() hosts with faction during hacking contracts (faction rep building).

*shortsticky.js - 26.70 GB - Stock manager requiring tix and api access.

*sinewave.js - 23.70 GB - Stock manger with no requirements.

start.js - 4.90 GB - A wget for loop with a start of "less8.js".

*Means scripts not written by me.
