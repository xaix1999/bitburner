**scripts used to automate hacking on all hosts

These are some scripts I use to auto exec hacks to auto gen cash in this game.
There are scripts from others that I have modified in order to "better" run in my play through.
Scripts have been updated to run on all bit nodes (maybe).
Your mileage may vary. Stocks & Hacknets seem to not be as profitable as I hoped.

V1.4.0 compatible

gen_auto.js - 8.20 GB - Was recently updated to avoid a race condition with a player owned server suddenly not being available. // i will likely change the name to something better

hnet.js - 6.10 GB - Set at buying 5 upgrades per cycle/chance (when the money is available), also added hash sells.

pserv.js - 9.50 GB - Almost unchanged from the original. // https://github.com/moriakaice/bitburner/blob/master/src/playerServers.ns

start.js - 4.15 GB - A brute force version of a wget with a start of programs.

stonks.js - 21.70 GB - Stock manager requiring tix and api access.
